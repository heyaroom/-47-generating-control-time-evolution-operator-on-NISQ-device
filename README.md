# -47-control-time-evolution-on-NISQ-devices

Project for [IBM qiskit camp asia](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-asia-19/issues/47)

Simulating of the quantum dynamics is one of the most interesting target in NISQ devices.
In this project, our aim is simulating controlled time evolution by extending VQE like method.
